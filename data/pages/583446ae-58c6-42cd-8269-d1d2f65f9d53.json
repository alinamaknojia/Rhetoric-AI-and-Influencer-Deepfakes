          "text": "This is a side by side comparison of a deepfake video and a real video of Anderson Cooper speaking (LipSynthesis 00:00-00:26). Cooper, a political commentator and broadcast journalist for CNN, was deepfaked on the right. The video exists to show off the capabilities of modern deepfake lipsyncing technology. The exigence is the dangers of deepfake technology, especially when used on famous and influential figures like Cooper. Believing in these realistic deepfakes can have greater consequences, like the spread of misinformation. The video creates a sense of urgency in viewers to be cautious about believing everything they see in the media. "

The purpose behind the video is to both highlight deepfake technology’s realism and the dangers of deepfaking famous figures as well as warn viewers to view media through a cautious critical and analytical perspective. This video also raises questions surrounding the ethics of deepfakes, as they can create “legal, moral, and social implications [that] demand serious consideration” (\"Anderson Cooper\")."

          "text": "The Cooper deepfake directly relates to our group theme of deepfaking celebrities and influential people online. These people have known reputations, whether good or bad, which causes people to be more likely to pay attention to what they say. Creating deepfakes of influential figures has a much larger audience reach and thus “have dramatic consequences for the public as these media sources create a complex of ignorance and misinformation” (Suciu 26). Rhetorical analysis of the video allows us to see how the video appeals to the audience's senses of logos, ethos, and pathos, especially with the usage of Cooper’s reputation as a known news broadcaster and using deepfake manipulation to play into the audiences’ fear of deepfake technology capabilities.
