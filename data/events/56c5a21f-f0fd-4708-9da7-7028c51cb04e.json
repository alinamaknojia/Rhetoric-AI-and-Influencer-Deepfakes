The irony is striking, he warns viewers about deepfakes while being one himself. In the end, it’s revealed that advanced editing technology was used to create the video, and the actual person behind the voice and facial expression is Jordan Peele. Also, a number of news broadcasting stations have shared this video and provided their thoughts on it. This highlights the significance of the topic and indicates that it requires more attention. This video serves to illustrate just how realistic and persuasive deepfakes can be, particularly when they involve prominent public figures. "
