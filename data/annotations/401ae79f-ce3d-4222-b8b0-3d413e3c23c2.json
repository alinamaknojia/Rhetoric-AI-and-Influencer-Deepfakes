              "text": "Ethos is established through the use of Anderson Cooper’s identity. His long-standing reputation as a credible journalist and trustworthy news anchor displays that he is reliable to viewers. Due to the audience viewing him as a respected and well-known media figure, they are more likely to immediately accept it without any questions. Because of his known reputation, viewers are likely to stay and watch rather than click off. However, when the audience actually hears what Cooper is speaking, they realize that the video is a deepfake of him, and it is not actually him speaking. This demonstrates how easily ethos can be artificially manipulated, causing viewers to initially believe the message based on who appears to be speaking rather than on evidence. \n"

The professional tone, news-style framing, and short format signal that this content is meant for everyday viewers rather than experts, relying on their existing trust in mainstream media figures. Being that the majority of his viewers are from his news channel, documentary, and podcast, a deepfake could easily persuade those who are unaware. More specifically, the audience is CNN viewers, since Cooper is a broadcaster for the CNN news channel. We can also infer that some of his audience are CBS news viewers, since Cooper was also a correspondent for “60 Minutes”, a show produced by CBS."

This approach provides a clear example of how easily an audience can be manipulated. By demonstrating the capabilities of deepfake technology, the video prompts viewers to think to themselves critically before believing what they see online. Moving forward, this will likely lead the viewers to analyze and question what they are seeing online and improve their media literacy.\n"

Viewers are more inclined to accept the message since it comes from a familiar and esteemed media personality. However, the true communicator is the creator of the deepfake, who is altering Cooper’s image and voice to convey a false message. This results in a strong rhetorical impact as it illustrates how easily credibility can be borrowed, or even stolen through technology. This video compels the audience to reflect on how much they depend on appearance and reputation when evaluating information.\n"

As a reliable anchor on CNN, Anderson Cooper embodies trustworthiness in broadcast journalism. The creation of a deepfake featuring someone in such a role directly undermines the credibility of televised news and online videos. The wider cultural background also encompasses rising political division and diminishing faith in media. In a setting where individuals already doubt what is genuine or biased, a realistic deepfake introduces an additional layer of doubt. This video exploits how viewers are accustomed to watching brief news segments online without consistently verifying their source. \n"
