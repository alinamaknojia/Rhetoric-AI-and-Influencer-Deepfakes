The professional tone, news-style framing, and short format signal that this content is meant for everyday viewers rather than experts, relying on their existing trust in mainstream media figures. Being that the majority of his viewers are from his news channel, documentary, and podcast, a deepfake could easily persuade those who are unaware. More specifically, the audience is CNN viewers, since Cooper is a broadcaster for the CNN news channel. We can also infer that some of his audience are CBS news viewers, since Cooper was also a correspondent for “60 Minutes”, a show produced by CBS."

As a prominent journalist and anchor for CNN, Cooper has established a reputation for trustworthiness, professionalism, and authority. The deepfake takes advantage of the pre-existing trust. Viewers are more inclined to accept the message since it comes from a familiar and esteemed media personality. However, the true communicator is the creator of the deepfake, who is altering Cooper’s image and voice to convey a false message. This results in a strong rhetorical impact as it illustrates how easily credibility can be borrowed, or even stolen through technology. This video compels the audience to reflect on how much they depend on appearance and reputation when evaluating information.\n"

The video appears at a time when misinformation rapidly circulates via social media, and digital editing tools have become increasingly more advanced and available. As a reliable anchor on CNN, Anderson Cooper embodies trustworthiness in broadcast journalism. The creation of a deepfake featuring someone in such a role directly undermines the credibility of televised news and online videos. The wider cultural background also encompasses rising political division and diminishing faith in media. In a setting where individuals already doubt what is genuine or biased, a realistic deepfake introduces an additional layer of doubt. This video exploits how viewers are accustomed to watching brief news segments online without consistently verifying their source. \n"
